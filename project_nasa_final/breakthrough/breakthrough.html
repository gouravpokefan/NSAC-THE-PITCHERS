      <p>Interstellar travel is the hypothetical travel by manned or unmanned spacecraft between stars or planetary systems in galaxy. The speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of space travel can provide. For both crewed and uncrewed interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met. Even the most optimistic views about interstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades from now. However, in spite of the challenges, if or when interstellar travel is realized, a wide range of scientific benefits is expected. Most interstellar travel concepts require a developed space logistics system capable of moving millions of tonnes to a construction / operating location, and most would require gigawatt-scale power for construction or power. There are 59 known stellar systems within 40 light years of the Sun, containing 81 visible stars.<br>

      <p>•  Pioneer 10 – launched in 1972, flew past Jupiter in 1973 and is heading in the direction of Aldebaran (65 light years away) in the constellation of Taurus. Contact was lost in January 2003, and it is estimated to have passed 120 AU.</p><p>
• Pioneer 11 – launched in 1973, flew past Jupiter in 1974 and Saturn in 1979. Contact was lost in November 1995, and it is estimated to be at around 100 AU. The spacecraft is headed toward the constellation of Aquila, northwest of the constellation of Sagittarius. Barring an incident, Pioneer 11 will pass near one of the stars in the constellation in about 4 million years.</p><p> 
• Voyager 2 – launched in August 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986, and Neptune in 1989. The probe left the heliosphere for interstellar space at 119 AU on 5 November 2018. Voyager 2 is still active. It is not headed toward any particular star, although in roughly 40,000 years it should pass 1.7 light-years from the star Ross 248. If undisturbed for 296,000 years, it should pass by the star Sirius at a distance of 4.3 light-years.</p><p>
• Voyager 1 – launched in September 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, making a special close approach to Saturn's moon Titan. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU on 25 August 2012 to enter interstellar space. Voyager 1 is still active. It is headed towards an encounter with star AC +79 3888, which lies 17.6 light-years from Earth, in about 40,000 years.</p><p>
• New Horizons – launched in 2006, the probe flew past Jupiter in 2007 and Pluto on 14 July 2015. It flew past the Kuper Belt object 486958 Arrokoth on January 1, 2019, as part of the Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM).

      <p>ALCUBIERRE WARP DRIVE: </p><p>In 1994, a Mexican physicist, Miguel Alcubierre, theorized that faster-than-light speeds were possible in a way that did not contradict Einstein by harnessing the expansion and contraction of space itself. Alcubierre proposed a new kind of technology that would allow us to travel 10 times faster than the speed of light without actually breaking the speed of light. That seems a bit contradictory, after all, we’ve been told by Dr. Einstein and others that light is the galactic speed limit – nothing in the cosmos can travel faster than it (much less 10 times faster) and herein lies the key to the Alcubierre drive: When you use it, you aren’t actually moving through space.

</p><p>PROJECT LONGSHOT :</p><p>A preliminary design is presented for an unmanned probe to Alpha Centauri with a planned launch early in the 21st century. The probe would be assembled at the space station and take approx. 100 yrs to reach the nearest star. Several technologies must be developed in order for this mission to be possible. A pulsed fusion microexplosion drive with 1,000,000 secs of specific impulse is the primary enabling technology. A large, long life fission reactor with 300 kW power output is also required. Communications lasers would use a 0.532 micrometer wavelength since there is minimal power output by the stars in that frequency band. A laser with an input power of 250 kW would allow for a data rate of 1000 bits per second at maximum range. There are 3 types of information to be gathered by the probe: properties of the interstellar medium, characteristics of the three star Alpha Centauri system, and astrometry.</p>

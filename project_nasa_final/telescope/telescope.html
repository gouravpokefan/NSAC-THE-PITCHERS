            <h2 class="media-heading">HUBBLE</h2>
            <p><p>From the dawn of humankind to a mere 400 years ago, all that we knew about our universe came through observations
                with the naked eye.
                Then Galileo turned his telescope toward the heavens in 1610. The world was in for an awakening.</p>
            
            <p>Saturn, we learned, had rings. Jupiter had moons. That nebulous patch across the center of the sky
                called the Milky Way was not a cloud but a collection of countless stars. Within but a few years, our notion of the
                natural world would be forever changed. A scientific and societal revolution quickly ensued. </p>
            
            <p>In the centuries that followed, telescopes grew in size and complexity and, of course, power. They were placed far
                from city lights and
                as far above the haze of the atmosphere as possible. Edwin Hubble, for whom the Hubble Telescope is named, used the
                largest telescope of
                his day in the 1920s at the Mt. Wilson Observatory near Pasadena, Calif., to discover galaxies beyond our own.</p>
            
            <p>Hubble, the observatory, is the first major optical telescope to be placed in space, the ultimate mountaintop. Above
                the distortion of
                the atmosphere, far far above rain clouds and light pollution, Hubble has an unobstructed view of the universe.
                Scientists have used Hubble to observe the most distant stars and galaxies as well as the planets in our solar
                system.</p>
            
            <p>Hubble's launch and deployment in April 1990 marked the most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo's
                telescope. Thanks to five servicing
                missions and more than 25 years of operation, our view of the universe and our place within it has never been the
                same.</p>

            <h1>Hubble Space Telescope Facts</h1>
            <p>NASA named the world's first space-based optical telescope after American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble (1889 -- 1953).
                Dr. Hubble confirmed an "expanding" universe, which
                provided the foundation for the big-bang theory.</p>

                <li>​Low Earth Orbit: Altitude of 340 miles (295 nautical miles, or 547 km), inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator
                </li>
                <li>Time to Complete One Orbit: about 95 minutes</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h2><b>Did you know...</b></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hubble has made more than 1.3 million observations since its mission began in 1990.</li>
                <li>Astronomers using Hubble data have published more than 15,000 scientific papers, making it one of the most
                    productive scientific instruments ever built. Those papers have been cited in other papers 738,000 times.</li>
                <li>Hubble does not travel to stars, planets or galaxies. It takes pictures of them as it whirls around Earth at
                    about 17,000 mph.</li>
                <li>Hubble has circled Earth and gone more than 4 billion miles along a circular low earth orbit currently about 340
                    miles in altitude.</li>
                <li>Hubble has no thrusters. To change angles, it uses Newton’s third law by spinning its wheels in the opposite
                    direction. It turns at about the speed of a minute hand on a clock, taking 15 minutes to turn 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>Hubble has the pointing accuracy of .007 arcseconds, which is like being able to shine a laser beam on President
                    Roosevelt’s head on a dime about 200 miles away.</li>
                <li>Outside the haze of our atmosphere, it can see astronomical objects with an angular size of 0.05 arcseconds,
                    which is like seeing a pair of fireflies in Tokyo that are less than 10 feet apart from Washington, DC.</li>
                <li>Due to the combination of optics and sensitive detectors and with no atmosphere to interfere with the light
                    reaching it, Hubble can spot a night light on the surface of the Moon from Earth.</li>
                <li>Hubble has peered back into the very distant past, to locations more than 13.4 billion light-years from Earth.
                </li>
                <li>Hubble generates about 10 terabytes of new data per year. The total archive is currently over 150 TB in size.
                </li>
                <li>Hubble weighed about 24,000 pounds at launch but if returned to Earth today would weigh about 27,000 pounds — on
                    the order of two full-grown African elephants.</li>
                <li>Hubble's primary mirror is 2.4 meters (7 feet, 10.5 inches) across. It was so finely polished that if you scaled
                    it to be the diameter of the Earth, you would not find a bump more than 6 inches tall.</li>
                <li>Hubble is 13.3 meters (43.5 feet) long — the length of a large school bus.</li>

        <h2 class="media-heading">KEPLER</h2>
        <p>The centuries-old quest for other worlds like our Earth has been rejuvenated by the intense excitement and popular
            interest
            surrounding the discovery of hundreds of planets orbiting other stars. There is now clear evidence for substantial
            numbers of
            three types of exoplanets; gas giants, hot-super-Earths in short period orbits, and ice giants. The challenge now is
            to find
            terrestrial planets (i.e., those one half to twice the size of the Earth), especially those in the habitable zone of
            their
            stars where liquid water might exist on the surface of the planet.</p>
        
        <p>The Kepler Mission is specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of
            Earth-size
            and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine the fraction of the hundreds of billions of stars in
            our galaxy
            that might have such planets.</p>
        
        <h3>Kepler Science</h3>
        <p>The scientific objective of the Kepler Mission is to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems. This
            is achieved
            by surveying a large sample of stars to:
        <ul>
            <li>Determine the percentage of terrestrial and larger planets that are in or near the habitable zone of a wide
                variety of stars</li>
            <li>Determine the distribution of sizes and shapes of the orbits of these planets</li>
            <li>Estimate how many planets there are in multiple-star systems</li>
            <li>Determine the variety of orbit sizes and planet reflectivities, sizes, masses and densities of short-period
                giant planets</li>
            <li>Identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques</li>
            <li>Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Transit Method of Detecting Extrasolar Planets</h3>
        <p>When a planet passes in front of a star as viewed from Earth, the event is called a “transit”. On Earth, we can
            observe an occasional
            Venus or Mercury transit. These events are seen as a small black dot creeping across the Sun—Venus or Mercury blocks
            sunlight as the
            planet moves between the Sun and us. Kepler finds planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when
            a planet crosses
            in front of it—we say the planet transits the star.<br><br>
        
            Once detected, the planet's orbital size can be calculated from the period (how long it takes the planet to orbit
            once around the star)
            and the mass of the star using Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion. The size of the planet is found from the
            depth of the transit
            (how much the brightness of the star drops) and the size of the star. From the orbital size and the temperature of
            the star, the planet's
            characteristic temperature can be calculated. From this the question of whether or not the planet is habitable (not
            necessarily inhabited) can be answered. </p>
        
        <h3>Target Field of View</h3>
        <p>Since transits only last a fraction of a day, all the stars must be monitored continuously, that is, their
            brightnesses must be measured
            at least once every few hours. The ability to continuously view the stars being monitored dictates that the field of
            view (FOV) must never
            be blocked at any time during the year. Therefore, to avoid the Sun the FOV must be out of the ecliptic plane. The
            secondary requirement is
            that the FOV have the largest possible number of stars. This leads to the selection of a region in the
            Cygnus and Lyra constellations of our Galaxy as shown.</p>

        <h2>Kepler's second mission: K2</h2>
        <p>The <a
                href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ends-attempts-to-fully-recover-kepler-spacecraft-potential-new-missions-considered/"
                target="blank">loss</a>
            of a second of the four reaction wheels on board the Kepler spacecraft in May 2013 brought an end to Kepler's
            four-year science mission
            to continuously monitor more than 150,000 stars to search for transiting exoplanets. Developed over the months
            following this failure, the
            <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..398H" targrt="blank">K2 mission</a> represents a new concept
            for spacecraft operations
            that enables continued scientific observations with the Kepler space telescope. K2
            became fully operational in May 2014 and is expected to continue operating until 2017 or 2018.</p>
        
        <p>Using the transit method to detect brightness changes, the K2 mission entails a series of sequential observing
            <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html" target="blank">"Campaigns"</a> of fields
            distributed around the ecliptic plane and offers a photometric precision <a
                href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-observing.html#fine-point-photometric-precision" target="blank">
                approaching that of the original Kepler mission.</a> Operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque
            exerted on the spacecraft by
            <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/ames/kepler-mission-manager-update-k2-has-been-approved" target="blank">
                solar wind pressure</a>, reducing pointing drift to the point where spacecraft
            attitude can effectively be controlled through a combination of thrusters and the two remaining reaction wheels.
            Each campaign is therefore
            limited by sun angle constraints to a duration of approximately 80 days.
        
        <h3>Scientific motivations</h3>
        <p>K2 is a community-driven mission. All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the
            <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html" target="blank">Guest Observer program</a>.
            The scientific
            potential spans a wide range of astrophysics. It is anticipated that K2 will:

            <p>The Spitzer Space Telescope, formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), was an infrared space telescope
                launched in 2003 and retired
                on 30 January 2020.The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission
                could extend to five or
                slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without
                liquid helium to cool the
                telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments were no longer usable. However,
                the two shortest-wavelength
                modules of the IRAC camera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the cryogen was exhausted, and
                continued to be used into
                early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission. Pre-launch tests had been conducted to determine the expected performance of
                the equipment in this state,
                along with tests at the University of Rochester , confirming the continuing capability of the detectors. During the
                warm mission, the two short
                wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 30 K, which was predicted to experience little to no degradation compared to
                the nominal mission.
                The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).</p>
            
            <h2><i>Mission Key Dates</i></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>
                        Aug. 25, 2003 — The Spitzer Space Telescope (then called the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, or SIRTF)
                        launches </b></li>
                aboard a Delta 7920H rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The spacecraft is launched into a
                solar,
                Earth-trailing orbit, far enough away from the planet so Earth's radiation does not interfere with the cooling of
                the telescope.
                The telescope’s dust cover was ejected Aug. 29 and its aperture door opened on Aug. 30.<br><br>
            
                <li><b>Dec. 1, 2003 — SIRTF begins regular operations,</b></li>
                following three months of in-orbit checkout procedures and verification of the spacecraft subsystems and science
                instruments.<br><br>
            
                <li><b>Dec. 18, 2003 — SIRTF is renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope</b></li>
                in honor of astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer, Jr. (1914-1997), one of the first people to propose the idea of using
                telescopes
                in space. The first Spitzer images and spectra are released to the public.<br><br>
            
                <li><b>May 15, 2009 — Spitzer depletes its onboard supply of liquid helium</b>,</li>
                used to cool the telescope mirror to as low as 5.5 degrees above absolute zero, or
                5.5 Kelvin (minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 267 degrees Celsius). This concludes
                Spitzer’s prime mission — also known as the “cold mission.” (The liquid helium supply lasted
                about 5 months longer than estimates made by the mission at launch, because of careful budgeting of the
                supply.)<br><br>
            
                <li><b>July 27, 2009 — Spitzer’s first mission extension begins</b>.</li>
                Without liquid helium, the spacecraft’s passive cooling system keeps the telescope
                temperature as low as 28.6 Kelvin (minus 408 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 244 degrees Celsius).
                Mission engineers are able to resume data collection using two out of four wavelength channels
                on the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) instrument. (Infrared wavelengths are often referred to by
                their physical length; in this case, 3.6 and 4.5 micrometers, or microns. A micron is about one millionth of a
                meter.)
                This becomes known as the “warm mission.” The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) instrument and the Multiband Imaging
                Photometer
                for Spitzer (MIPS) instruments cannot operate in this temperature range because the detectors warm up and produce
                overwhelming noise in the signal.<br><br>
            
                <li><b>January 1, 2015 — The second Spitzer mission extension begins.</b></li><br>
            
                <li><b>January 1, 2017 — The third Spitzer mission extension begins.</b></li><br>
            
                <li><b>Oct. 1, 2017 — The fourth Spitzer mission extension begins.</b></li>
                This period forward is dubbed the Spitzer Beyond Mission.<br><br>

        <h2 class="media-heading">Chandra X-ray Observatory</h2>
        <p>
<p>The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO), previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), is a
            Flagship-class
            space telescope launched aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia during STS-93 by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is
            sensitive to X-ray
            sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors.
            Since the
            Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes;
            therefore space-based
            telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its
            mission is ongoing as of 2020.</p>
        
        <p>Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
            (1991-2000),
            and the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003-2020). The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning Indian
            astrophysicist Subrahmanyan
            Chandrasekhar. Its mission is similar to that of ESA's XMM-Newton spacecraft, also launched in 1999 but the two
            telescopes have
            different design foci; Chandra has much higher angular resolution.</p>
        
        <h2>Discoveries</h2>
        <p>The data gathered by Chandra has greatly advanced the field of X-ray astronomy. Here are some examples of discoveries
            supported by observations
            from Chandra:
        <ul>
            <li>The first X-ray emission was seen from the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, at the center of the Milky
                Way. (Baganoff, et al., 2001)</li>
            <li>Chandra found much more cool gas than expected spiraling into the center of the Andromeda Galaxy.</li>
            <li>Pressure fronts were observed in detail for the first time in Abell 2142, where clusters of galaxies are
                merging.</li>
            <li>The earliest images in X-rays of the shock wave of a supernova were taken of SN 1987A.</li>
            <li>X-ray emission lines were associated for the first time with a gamma-ray burst, Beethoven Burst GRB 991216.
                (Piro, et al., 2000)</li>
            <li>High school students, using Chandra data, discovered a neutron star in supernova remnant IC 443.</li>
            <li>Observations by Chandra and BeppoSAX suggest that gamma-ray bursts occur in star-forming regions.</li>
            <li>TWA 5B, a brown dwarf, was seen orbiting a binary system of Sun-like stars.</li>
            <li>Nearly all stars on the main sequence are X-ray emitters. (Schmitt & Liefke, 2004)</li>
            <li>The X-ray shadow of Titan was seen when it transitted the Crab Nebula.</li>
            <li>X-ray emissions from materials falling from a protoplanetary disc into a star. (Kastner, et al., 2004)</li>
            <li>Hubble constant measured to be 76.9 km/s/Mpc using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.</li>
            <li>2006 Chandra found strong evidence that dark matter exists by observing super cluster collision</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technical description</h2>
        <p>Unlike optical telescopes which possess simple aluminized parabolic surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally
            use a Wolter telescope
            consisting of nested cylindrical paraboloid and hyperboloid surfaces coated with iridium or gold. X-ray photons
            would be absorbed by normal
            mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of
            nested mirrors, together with
            their support structure, called the High Resolution Mirror Assembly (HRMA); the mirror substrate is 2 cm-thick
            glass, with the reflecting
            surface a 33 nm iridium coating, and the diameters are 65 cm, 87 cm, 99 cm and 123 cm.[26] The thick substrate and
            particularly careful
            polishing allowed a very precise optical surface, which is responsible for Chandra's unmatched resolution: between
            80% and 95% of the
            incoming X-ray energy is focused into a one-arcsecond circle. However, the thickness of the substrate limits the
            proportion of the aperture
            which is filled, leading to the low collecting area compared to XMM-Newton.</p>
        
        <p>CXO uses mechanical gyroscopes,[28] which are sensors that help determine what direction the telescope is
            pointed.[29] Other navigation
            and orientation systems on board CXO include an aspect camera, Earth and Sun sensors, and reaction wheels. It also
            has two sets of thrusters,
            one for movement and another for offloading momentum.</p>
        <h3>Instruments</h3>
        
        <p>The Science Instrument Module (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
            (ACIS) and the High Resolution
            Camera (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.</p>
        
        <p>ACIS consists of 10 CCD chips and provides images as well as spectral information of the object observed. It operates
            in the photon energy range
            of 0.2–10 keV. HRC has two micro-channel plate components and images over the range of 0.1–10 keV. It also has a
            time resolution of 16 microseconds.
            Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory's two transmission
            gratings.</p>
